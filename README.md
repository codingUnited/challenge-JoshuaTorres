# CodingUnited Challenge 1 - Joshua Torres

Completing this challenge reinforced my understanding of Git branching strategies, effective use of feature branches and pull requests, and integrating CSS styling in static web pages.

## Challenge Levels Completed

### Easy
- Created a public repository under the codingUnited organization named `challenge-JoshuaTorres`.
- Added a folder `challenge1-GithubRepoCreation`.
- Created a simple `index.html` file displaying the text: "Ready to Code!".

###  Medium
- Cloned the repository locally using Git.
- Made changes to the `index.html` file using a local code editor (VS Code).
- Used a separate feature branch (`feature/add-local-changes`) to manage my changes.
- Opened a pull request to merge my feature branch into the main branch.

###  Hard
- Added basic CSS styling to the `index.html` file, including the color orange as a key style element.
- Created a GitHub Issue to track my progress throughout the challenge.
- Added this `README.md` file to explain the project and setup steps.

### Leet (Planned/To Do)
- Plan to enable GitHub Pages to publish the HTML file online.
- Will add a `.gitignore` file and explain its purpose.
- Will set up a simple GitHub Action triggered on push (e.g., linter or echo command).
- Bonus: Add a favicon and/or use a custom font for the webpage.
